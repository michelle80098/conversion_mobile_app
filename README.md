# Overview

People carry their smartphones everywhere they go and utilize them on a regular basis. An essential skill for the industry is the ability to create mobile applications. A straightforward conversion tool from gallons to milliliter was developed for Android mobile devices. The program consists of two pages; the first screen shows the main page and a "conversion: button. When you click it, you'll be taken to a second page with an input box where you may type the number you want to be converted to. Following the entry of the number, the user can choose between two buttons. One button changes the unit of measurement from gallons to milliliters.
